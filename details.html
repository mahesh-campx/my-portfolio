      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Software Developer Trainee at <strong>CampX Digital Campus Ecosystem</strong>.
          working on real-world products used by colleges and universities.
            I build responsive front-end applications using React and develop scalable backend services with Node.js / NestJS.
            I work with REST and GraphQL APIs, integrating them into our micro-service-based architecture.
            I also customize Frappe / ERPNext modules to automate workflows for academic institutions.
            My development approach focuses on clean code, readability, and maintainability.
            I enjoy translating product requirements into functional UI and API implementations.
            My background in networking (Cisco/Juniper, routing/switching) helps me understand systems end-to-end.
            I collaborate closely with designers, QA, and product teams to ship features smoothly.
            Learning and improving every day is something I strongly believe in.
            My goal is to grow into a full-stack product engineer and build software that solves real problems.
